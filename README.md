  - One page listing products you can purchase.
  - Page should have a header with a cart icon on the top left. This icon should display the number of items in the cart.
  - Add/remove button on item to update the cart.
- Please use styled components to make it look aesthetically appealing ðŸŒ¸, React hooks and Redux to manage the state for items in cart.

**Keep in mind**
